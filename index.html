    <h2>Some weird questions I've been asked (That you also might be wondering):</h2>
    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>No</p>
    <h4>What's the name of your first pet?</h4>
    <p>That's a security question. No one should answer that.</p>
    <h4>Laptop of choice?</h4>
    <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T460s, I've been though 3 of them. (I actually recommend the T470s now if you want a good, used ThinkPad)</p>
    <h4>Why don't you have any public repos?</h4>
    <p>:shrug: I haven't had the time to clear out sensitive information, and to be quite frank, none is of worth.</p>
    <h4>Cars are expensive. Why do you like to hack them?</h4>
    <p>Why not? Everything has computers, someone's gotta test it!</p>
    <h4>We want you to work here. Where is your resume?</h4>
    <p>Email me. I'm constantly updating my resume so it would be difficult to keep it up to date.</p>
    <h4>Why do you sound so cold hearted in this section?</h4>
    <p>I'm going to attribute it to the fact that it's 00:28 in the morning and this is my method of procrastinating instead of studying for my CCNA later today.</p>
    <h4>I want to publish something about you!</h4>
    <p>Email me.</p>
