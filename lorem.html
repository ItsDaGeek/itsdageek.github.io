		<h4>Design and Typography chapter</h4>
		<p id=lotstext>
			The word design, when used in connection with books, magazines, and other printed materials, refers to the arrangement of
			elements on the printed page. In addition to the typographical elements, such as the size and style of type, the length
			of lines, and the space between lines, the design of the page often includes tables, illustrations, and the use of color.
			Although some aspects of designing pages with illustrations are discussed in the section on Tables and Illustrations in
			this chapter, the chapter focuses mainly on typographical elements of page design. More information about designing pages
			can be found under the heading Production, Design, and Printing 1n the Bibliography at the back of this book.
		</p>
		<p id=lotstext>
			As was pointed out in the preceding chapter, books, magazines, and other printed materials are often designed by professional
			graphic designers; however, writers and editors are often called upon to work in consultation with designers. And in some
			cases, writers and editors are required to design materials on their own. It is to meet these two basic needs-to help
			writers and editors communicate with designers and to help writers and editors design materials for themselves when it
			is necessary to do so--that this chapter has been written.
		</p>
		<p id=lotstext>
			All typefaces are designed with a certain amount of space above and be. low so that the descenders on one line do not crash
			into or even touch the ascenders on the following line. However, the amount of space left over varies widely, as the illustration
			on this page points out. A face like Helvetica leaves almost no space between the descenders of one line and the ascenders
			of the next; Times Roman leaves a good deal of space.
		</p>
		<p id=lotstext>
			No matter what style of type is being used, page designers usuall add some additional spaces between lines in order to improve
			the legib' ity of the page and to keep it from looking too crowded. The amount of additional space that is used between
			the lines is referred to as leading. Like so many terms in typography, leading is a term that dates back to the time when
			typesetters set type by positioning pieces of metal type inside trays called alleys. In order to add spacing between lines
			of type they would add in strips of lead between the rows. (For more on how type was and now is set, see Chapter 13, “Composition,
			Printing, and Bind-v ing.”) The amount of space that is actually necessary between lines will vary with the size of the
			type, the length of the line, and to some extent, individual taste. In general, the smaller the type and the lon er the
			line, the greater the s acmg ought to be in relation to the size of e type.
		</p>
		<p id=lotstext>
			As we said above, the size of type is measured in points. The size of type used for most of the text in this book is 10-point
			type. What this means in the typeface we are using, which is Baskerville, is that the distance from the top of the tallest
			letter to the bottom of the lowest descender is in points. In some type styles the distance from the top to the bottom
			will be slightly less than its stated point size, but in no case will it be greater. The illustration on this page demonstrates
			the variety of actual sizes that correspond to a same point 8126 for a selection of typefaces. Note how much the x height
			varies in each of these styles. This is an important factor to keep in mind when deciding how much space to leave tween
			lines of type, as will be explained below.
		</p>
		<p id=lotstext>
			In addition to its vertical dimension, type also has a horizontal dimension, which varies from letter to letter. The capital
			M or capital W is usually the widest letter; the lowercase i is usually the narrowest. The only good way, then, to think
			about the width of characters is in terms of an average, usually given as the average number of characters that can be
			set per pica. For example, the 10-point Baskerville on this page averages 2.55 characters per pica.

		<h4>Composition, Printing, and Binding</h4>
		<p id=lotstext>
			Most written material that is going to be distributed to a large audience goes through the processes of composition, printing,
			and binding. As the preceding two chapters have shown, authors and editors often become involved with composition. The
			printing and binding processes, however, are usually more remote. The purpose of this chapter is to give writers, editors,
			and other production people an overview of these processes and to introduce some of the concepts and vocabulary relating
			to them. Throughout this chapter, composition, printing, and binding are described in terms of book manufacturing. It
			should be understood, however, at least with composition and printing, that the processes described are the same for books,
			magazines, pamphlets, or single sheets of paper. The descriptions that follow are extremely simplified. They are in tended
			to give those writers, editors, and production people who know virtually nothing about book manufacturing a very brief
			introduction to the processes that go on after manuscript editing and markup is complete. Readers who anticipate having
			major responsibilities regarding the supervision of a book or other publication through any of the processes described
			in this section are urged to consult one or more of the books listed under the heading Production, Design, and Printing
			in the Bibliography at the end of this book.
		</p>
		<p id=lotstext>
			Traditionally, discussions of the composition, printing, and binding processes begin with an explanation of handset type
			and letterpress printing, despite the fact that most of today's writers and editors will probably never encounter either
			of them. Handset type is type that is set by i worker who assembles individual pieces of metal type, one piece for each
			letter on the page, into frames that hold a page’s worth 0 type. Letter' press printing is done by inking the raised surfaces
			of those pieces of type and pressing the pieces of paper that are to become the pages of the book against them. liandsetting
			and letterpress printing were once common in the printing industry, an many of the concepts and much of the vocab« ulary
			involved with modern composition and printing are derived from these earlier processes. However, the technology of composition
			and printing has proceeded so far that the connection between today’s rocesses and earlier processes is becoming more
			and more remote. his chapter will focus on some typical composition, printing, and binding systems that are in use today.
			Readers who are interested in some of the earlier processes should consult the sources listed under the heading Production
			and Printing in the Bibliography at the end of this book.
		</p>
		<p id=lotstext>
			Book manufacturing, in the typical arrangement that we are describing in this chapter, involves first a typesetting company,
			often referred to as the compositor, that takes the author’s edited manuscript and the designers’s specifications and
			from these two sources creates a high-quality, black-and-white image of each page of the book exactly as it will appear
			in its final form. Through a series of steps, some of which may be carried out in the typesetter’s shop but most of which
			are done in the printing plant, this high-quality picture is transferred to a printing plate that will be used for laying
			down ink on paper. This plate is mounted on a printing press and inked. The ink is transferred to paper by pressing the
			inked plate against the paper, which is fed into the printing press either as single sheets or on a continuous roll. After
			the paper has been printed on both sides, it is folded, trimmed, and bound together.
		</p>
		<p id=lotstext>
			All of the processes mentioned in the preceding paragraph can take place within one shop, but more typically a publication
			will be typeset by one company and printed and bound by another. Within a publishing company, these processes may be supervised
			by a manufacturing manager or a production manager. A common arrangement involves the production department's being responsible
			for typesetting and the manfacturing department’s overseeing all printing and binding.
