            The word design, when used in connection with books, magazines, and other printed materials, refers to the arrangement of elements on the printed page. In addition to the typographical elements, such as the size and style of type, the length of lines, and the space between lines, the design of the page often includes tables, illustrations, and the use of color. Although some aspects of designing pages with illustrations are discussed in the section on Tables and Illustrations in this chapter, the chapter focuses mainly on typographical elements of page design. More information about designing pages can be found under the heading Production, Design, and Printing 1n the Bibliography at the back of this book.
